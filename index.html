                Dearest New Friend,
                <br><br>
                I trust this note finds you in good spirits. It is with great pleasure that I write to extend to you an invitation of the utmost importance, on behalf of our esteemed friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. In his unending quest for worthy allies in the pursuit of truth and justice, Mr. Holmes has devised a challenge—a test of wit and intellect. He believes, as do I and Dr. Watson, that you possess the aptitude and determination required to excel. Enclosed within this note is a cipher—a coded message to be deciphered. Should you successfully unravel its secrets, you will not only earn Mr. Holmes's admiration but also the honor of joining his esteemed detective agency. Mr. Holmes has provided a clue to aid you:
                To begin at the beginning, remember that every journey starts with the letter A. The wheel below may be of some use. The key, which is used to unlock the secrets, lies in the power of rotation, where each turn may reveal new paths and hidden truths.
                <br><br>
                The key	: XZ Q TRDPC FIJK, USVONMT CF EFHJRV
                <br><br>
                The cipher	: QN Q ZIHPV RQWN, HGOVVZZ KX PNACCZ
                <br><br>
                Mr. Holmes also has instructed me to provide you with the link through which you may send the deciphered message. Please find it enclosed 
                <a href="https://forms.gle/Wv3WoPavrH7Ax2bG7">https://forms.gle/Wv3WoPavrH7Ax2bG7</a>
                <br><br>
                Wishes of luck to you. Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson, and I will wait for your correspondence.
                Sincerely,
                <br><br>
